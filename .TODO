UI:
    ☐ setup UI into the TileEntity
        ☐ on/off button
        ☐ dynamic ratio of needed materials / available materials (with refresh button ?)
        ☐ show active cooldown || time to repair all

To be implemented (or not ?):
    ☐ Cooldown: a period of time during which no repair can be launched
    ☐ RepairSpeed: an amount of damage which can be repaired in one UpdateTick event
    ☐ Better UI inside the loot container
    ☐ electricity needed to launch a repair ?
    ☐ if electricity needed -> increase repair speed according to max received power
    ☐ make block ignoring in bfs more generic, by specifying explicit blocks to ignore.

To be fixed:
    ☐ Spike blocks at stage Dmg1 or Dmg2 with block.damage = 0 are upgraded for free at stage Dmg0

Config:
    ☐ import `COOLDOWN` duration from config.xml
    ☐ import `MAX_ITERTIONS` for bfs from config.xml
    ☐ import `NEEDS_MATERIAL` on/off from config.xml
    ☐ import `IGNORED_BLOCKS` from config.xml
